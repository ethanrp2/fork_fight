# ForkFight — UIUC’s Restaurant Ranking Game

ForkFight is a swipe-based restaurant ranking app built for UIUC students who are sick of hearing the same five places recommended over and over. Instead of relying on outdated Google reviews or random GroupMe opinions, ForkFight lets students compare restaurants head-to-head and generates **personalized and global rankings** based on real preferences.

This repo contains the mobile-first prototype, ELO engine, matchup flow, and ranking UI.

## Why UIUC Needs This
UIUC’s food ecosystem is broken in a very specific way:
- Everyone recommends the same places (“BL, Thai Fusion, Shawty’s”)  
- No one agrees on what’s actually *good*  
- Group chats spiral into pointless debates  
- Reviews on Google/Yelp are useless for students because the context is different  
- There’s no central, trustworthy ranking built on actual **student taste**  

ForkFight fixes this by turning restaurant discovery into a simple binary decision:
> “Between these two UIUC spots, which would I actually go to right now?”

Students end up with rankings that feel accurate because they come from *their own choices*.

## What ForkFight Measures
Every restaurant is scored across three student-relevant dimensions:

### 🎨 Aesthetics  
Vibe, interior, plating, and whether you’d actually bring someone there.

### 💸 Value  
How much you get for the price — essential for college students.

### ⚡ Speed  
How fast the food comes out — clutch during busy schedules.

The swiping game contributes to **all three leaderboards**, broken down into:
- **Global Rankings** — what the entire campus thinks  
- **Personal Rankings** — your taste profile built from your swipes
